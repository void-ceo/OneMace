**Tired of plugins that _claim_ to fix multiple Maces—but don’t?**

OneMace enforces a hard limit: players can have only **one** Mace. **No** bypasses. **Period.**

**OneMace** introduces a unique gameplay twist by limiting the **entire server** to a **single Mace**. No more spamming Maces—strategy and skill are key! Perfect for **Lifesteal** and **competitive** **PvP** servers that want to balance the game.

- The plugin stores the crafted state in **config.yml**, so it remains saved across **restarts**.
- The Mace recipe is **re-enabled** if the Mace is **destroyed** (e.g., lava, void, breaking).
- Announcements for crafting & destruction can be enabled/disabled in **config.yml**.
- Maces are tracked inside supported nested item storage and modern block/entity inventories.

## Configuration
_Make sure the server is not running before making changes!_
```
settings:
  mace-crafted: false  # Changes to true when the Mace is crafted.
  mace-owner: null  # Stores the UUID of the current owner, or null if no owner.
  announce-mace-messages: true  # If true, broadcasts when the Mace is crafted or lost.
  allow-locate-for-all: false # If true, allows any player to use the '/onemace locate' subcommand.
  colored-name: false # If true, the player that has the Mace will have a colored name.
  mace-name-color: "RED" # The color of the name, use Chat Colors.
  optional-allowed-containers: # Containers that the Mace is allowed to be placed into.
    - ENDER_CHEST
    - ANVIL
    - ENCHANTING

# Stores whether an offline player logged out with the Mace.
# If set to true, the Mace is in their inventory or Ender Chest when they logged out.
# Used to prevent crafting if the Mace still exists in an offline player’s possession.
# This is automatically updated when a player logs out or the server shuts down.
offline_inventory: {}

# Customizable messages
messages:
  crafted: "&b[OneMace] &eThe Mace has been crafted!"
  lost: "&b[OneMace] &eThe Mace has been lost!"
```
## Commands
```/onemace locate``` -
Allows you to locate the Mace.

**Required permission:** 
```onemace.admin```
- description: Allows using admin subcommands

**Required permission:** 
```onemace.admin```
- description: Allows using admin subcommands

## Setup
Put the ```jar``` file into your server's **plugins** folder.

**Restart** the server.

## Bypasses & Limitations
⚠️ **Maces in unloaded chunks cannot be scanned directly.** OneMace keeps crafting disabled when the persisted state says a Mace still exists, including tracked offline-player inventories. `/onemace fix` will not assume the Mace is gone just because it cannot currently be found in loaded chunks.

Otherwise, this plugin should work perfectly on a clean vanilla server.
